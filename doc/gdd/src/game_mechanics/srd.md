Adding Attribute modifier

## Target Number(TN)

Idea: the TN could be 3/4 of the maximum of your skill dice
ex: skill level 12 TN would be 26 / 4 \* 3

## Margin of Success(MoS) System

Depending on the difference with the target number(TN) will give extra bonus( good or bad )

### Combat

In combat it will add damage to the hit

### Craft

It will determine the quality of the craft
Idea: every +4 gets a step on quality, having 6 qualities( skills scale +2 so using +4 makes qualities half of number of skills)

## Exploding Dice Mechanic

If you get the highest number possible you will be able to roll **one** more dice of your base roll for extra benefits
