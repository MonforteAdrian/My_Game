# Concept

There are two game modes: settlement and adventure. You will be able to change between them knowing that the time don't stop; if you are in adventure your settlement keep running.

### Settlement mode

- Starting with x settlers.
- Collect resources; food, wood, stone, seeds...
- Use those resources to build; houses, workshops, comunal buildings, defenses...
- Automate the behaviors and focus on greater things; fight against enemies, conquer, rule over the nearby lands, explore...

### Adventure mode

- Focus on one character.
- Explore the world; other settlements, cities, nature...
- Learn; skills from hermits lost in the mountains, universities...
  Learning alone is slower than if someone teach you but you learn more in depth.
- Discover lost secrets...

### Multiplayer

The multiplayer system will work as local servers created by the players.
Both modes will be available in multiplayer.

One map per server, all the players in that map simultaniously.
